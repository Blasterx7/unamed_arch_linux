# Store folder

For this project, store is used like the ram of the computer. It was used to manage active process, terminal and much more. 

For example, the `TerminalStore` is used to manage the terminal and the commands that are executed in the terminal. The `AppStore` is used to manage the apps that are installed on the system. The `SettingsStore` is used to manage the settings of the system.

If you are a contributor, you can add your own stores to this folder to extend the functionality of the project.
