# Utils folder

The utils folder contains utility functions and classes that are used throughout the project. These utilities are used to perform common tasks, such as formatting dates, generating unique IDs, and more.

For the moment, the utils folder is unused. If your are contibutor, please overrides this file and add your own utils functions to specify others contributors what you have added.
